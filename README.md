This script creates a simple 3D-style house drawing using the Pycairo library and saves it as output.png. Here’s a summary of what each part of the script does and some additional details in case you’d like to adjust or improve it.
Project: 3D House Drawing with Pycairo
Description

This script generates a 3D-style house illustration using the Pycairo graphics library. The drawing includes:

    A house with multiple walls represented by polygons.
    Windows on the front and side walls.
    A tilted roof to give a 3D perspective.
    A small circle acting as a door handle.

Script Breakdown

    Imports and Constants:
        cairo is imported to handle the drawing.
        WIDTH and HEIGHT define the canvas size.

    Helper Functions:
        set_rgb_color(context, r, g, b) is a helper function to convert RGB values (0-255) to a scale suitable for Pycairo (0-1).

    Surface and Background Setup:
        Creates a surface (canvas) and sets the background color to white.

    Drawing the House Components:
        Multiple move_to and line_to methods are used to draw walls and roof polygons.
        Each polygon is stroked with black and filled with a specified color.
        Windows are added on the house's front and side, with additional lines for visual window dividers.

    Adding Details:
        A small circle is drawn as a doorknob.
        Additional strokes and fills are used to give windows and other elements a layered effect.

    Saving the Output:
        The final drawing is saved as output.png.

How to Run the script:

To run this script:

    Ensure Pycairo is installed:

pip install pycairo

Run the script:

    python 3d_house.py

The script will generate a file called output.png with the 3D house drawing.
Customizations

    Colors: Adjust the RGB values in the set_rgb_color calls to change the color scheme.
    Dimensions and Positions: Modify the move_to and line_to coordinates to adjust the size and shape of the house and roof.
    Additional Elements: You can add more details like trees, clouds, or a sun by using similar drawing functions.

Example Output

After running the script, you should see an output file named output.png with a stylized 3D house image.
Notes

This example provides a basic structure that you can expand on by adding other elements or adjusting colors and shapes to create a unique illustration.
